    Testimonials<br>
    Alumna Annika ten Velden<br>
    Security consultant, NVISO<br>
    After my Master in Criminology, I was looking for a dedicated education in IT-security and forensic investigation. The bachelor program Cyber Security Professional corresponded perfectly with my needs.<br>
    As my background was in social sciences rather than in technical sciences, I did expect a challenge. As Howest focuses on the practical rather than the theoretical and offers extra support where necessary, I achieved my degree without a problem.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Because of the profound knowledge acquired in IT-security – from pentesting to forensic analysis – I received many job offers. My work at NVISO for the last five years has focused on incident response and forensic investigations. I still have regular contact with Howest and can tell from its trainees that education continuously evolves and is adapted to the needs of the employer community.
